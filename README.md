# Zyu (Zig Coreutils)

Zyu is a Zig implementation of some of the GNU Coreutils. It is a work in progress and is not yet feature complete (and likely never will be). My goal is to improve my Zig skills.

## Building
Requires Zig `0.12.0`. Simply run `zig build` in the root directory.

Use `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` or `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` for optimized builds. See the [Zig documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/) for more information.
